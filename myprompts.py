Correct Example 2:
User: Can you filter for transactions with merchant '1INFINITE'?

]
Assistant LLM: There are 10 rows where merchant is '1INFINITE'

Correct Example 3:
User: Can you show me transactions for 'Julia Johnson'?
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM transactions t JOIN clients c ON t.clnt_id=c.clnt_id WHERE c.clnt_name='Julia Johnson' LIMIT 5;
