Prompt Template: You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
Important: Do not include "Question: " in your answer. You are not allowed to generate Questions.
Important: You should never include ``` in the generated SQL Query as this is not a valid syntax. e.g. ``` SELECT * FROM transations ``` is not allowed.

The below are correct examples of how you should reason about your answer:
Correct Example 1:
User: How many records are there in 'transactions' table?
SQL Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;
SQL Query Result: 5
Assistant LLM: There are two records in the transactions table

Correct Example 2:
User: Can you filter for transactions with merchant '1INFINITE'?
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE merchant='1INFINITE' LIMIT 5;
SQL Query Result: [
    4	28	1	1	108	2023-07-25 00:00:00	1INFINITELOOP@ 07/25 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA	59.1	Shops	1INFINITE,
    5	28	1	1	136	2023-08-14 00:00:00	1INFINITELOOP@ 08/14 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA	4.924	Shops	1INFINITE
]
Assistant LLM: There are 10 rows where merchant is '1INFINITE'

Correct Example 3:
User: Can you show me transactions for 'Julia Johnson'?
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM transactions t JOIN clients c ON t.clnt_id=c.clnt_id WHERE c.clnt_name='Julia Johnson' LIMIT 5;
SQL Query Result: [
    1	6	1	1	54	2023-07-31 00:00:00	CLOC Advance	6.286	Shops	NULL	6	Julia Johnson,

]
Assistant LLM: Julia Johnson has 5 transactions in total.

Correct Example 4:
User: Can you show total amount of money for transactions for 'Julia Johnson'?
SQL Query: SELECT SUM(t.amt) FROM transactions t JOIN clients c ON t.clnt_id=c.clnt_id WHERE c.clnt_name='Julia Johnson' LIMIT 5;
SQL Query Result: [
    1	6	1	1	54	2023-07-31 00:00:00	CLOC Advance	6.286	Shops	NULL	6	Julia Johnson,
    2	6	1	1	27	2023-07-31 00:00:00	CLOC Advance	6.286	Shops	NULL	6	Julia Johnson,

Assistant LLM: Julia Johnson has 5 transactions in total.

Question: {input}


Question 1: How many rows are in the 'transactions' table?
Answer 1: There are 257063 rows in the transactions table.
Question 2: Can you filter for transactions with merchant '1INFINITE'?
Answer 2: There are 5 transactions with merchant '1INFINITE'. The transactions are:
1. 1INFINITELOOP@ 07/25 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA for 59.1 in Shops category
2. 1INFINITELOOP@ 08/14 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA for 4.924 in Shops category
3. 1INFINITELOOP@ 08/20 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA for 98.5 in Shops category
4. 1INFINITELOOP@ 08/19 #68 PMNT RCVD 1INFINITELOOP@APP 68 CA for 59
Question 3: How much did Julia Johnson spend last week?
Error: Error processing query: (sqlite3.OperationalError) near "(": syntax error
[SQL: (Assuming that 'clnt_name' is a string and 'amt' is a float)

```
SELECT SUM(CAST(amt AS REAL))
FROM transactions
WHERE txn_date >= DATE('now','-7 days')
AND clnt_name = 'Julia Johnson';
```

Note: The CAST function is used to convert the 'amt' column to a real number, as it is assumed to be a string in the original query.

Also, I've used single quotes for the string 'Julia Johnson' as per SQLite syntax.]

Question 4: How much did clnt_id=6 spend last week?
Answer 4: The client with clnt_id=6 did not have any transactions last week.
Question 5: What is the amount Julia Johnson have spent on Uber in the last 5 months?
Error: Error processing query: (sqlite3.OperationalError) near "(": syntax error
[SQL: (Assuming all the column names are correct and the data types are properly matched)

```
SELECT SUM(t.amt)

INNER JOIN clients c ON t.clnt_id=c.clnt_id
WHERE c.clnt_name='Julia Johnson' AND t.merchant LIKE '%Uber%' AND t.txn_date >= DATE('now','-5 month');
